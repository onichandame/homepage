title: 'Budget Kubernetes on GKE'

**Prologue:** If you want to start playing with Kubernetes, read it through. If
you are an expert looking for a low-cost cluster like me, read it through.

# Demand of Cheap Kubernetes

Since its emerge, Kubernetes(k8s) has been the game changer in the IT industry.
Today it can be viewed as the de facto standard container orchestration
platform. The only problem is the high cost and the deep learning curve.

For employers, hiring a k8s expert is not an easy and cheap task. For k8s
enthusiasts, practicing on a k8s cluster is not cheap either. Hence there is a
gap between the number of available experts and the demand. The solution to this
dilemma is a cheap cluster with which amateurs can easily practice and improve
their skills.

# GKE

Google Cloud provides managed k8s clusters at a cost. The sweet thing is that
the cost can be reduced to near zero. Let me break down the costs and explain
how to avoid them. All the information comes from the [official
doc][gce-free-limit].

## Cluster

Every cluster is charged is charged at maximum $74.4 per month as the management
fee, except the first cluster in the account. Hence $0 for management.

## Nodes

A cluster needs at least one node to function. In some data centers(Oregon, Iowa
and S. Carolina) every account can use one `e2-micro`(2 cores, 1G RAM) instance
for free. Besides the resources consumed by the basic k8s pods, there are around
400-500 Mb of RAM available for workloads. Hence $0 for a single node. If more
nodes are needed, spot instance is another cheap option if availability is not
the first priority, which is true for most personal use cases.

## Traffic

When workloads are deployed, you may wish to expose them to the internet. The
cost of egress traffic can be reduced by [2 measures][gce-network-pricing]:

1. Use Premium network under Free Tier limit if:
   - clients are not in China or Australia
   - monthly usage below 1 GB
1. Use Standard network at a very low cost($0.085 per GB)

## Storage

For stateful applications like databases it is vital to keep data persistent
across workloads' lifecycle. 30 GB of standard persistent disk is free for every
account.

# How To Use

All the needed pieces are provided by GKE, the only problem is how to combine
them for practical use.

The first step is to create the cluster. You can choose free single-node cluster
or cheap multi-node cluster depending on your need. The firewall rules should be
set so that HTTP and HTTPS requests are permitted.

The second step is to install an ingress controller in order to provide service
from multiple workloads in the cluster. The details can be found in [this
repo][cluster].

Now the cluster is ready for use. Although being too weak to support heavy
workloads, it is sufficient for personal practice. My last advice is to setup a
[budget][gce-budget] so that you won't be surprised if Google decides to
withdraw its free tier offers.
