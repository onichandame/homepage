As an approach(probably the best approach) to the next generation web, IPFS emerged as a complete stack aiming to replace the current HTTP protocol. This post records my efforts in developing web services based on IPFS.

# Hosting

The hosting of IPFS is much simpler than that in HTTP as it is essentially the same as sharing files using p2p protocols and file sharing is pretty much mature already.

# Database

The database is at the core of web services.
