On a fresh-new CentOS 8 desktop, it is not trivial to get a Bluetooth headset connected for the first time.

# Symptoms

When trying to connect to a paired headset in Bluetooth settings, it keeps failing but not error log can be seen. The logs can be retrieved by running command `journalctl -xe` and scroll up to find the read lines similar to `a2dp-sink profile connect failed for 5C:C6:E9:B9:9D:DE: Protocol not available`.

This error message tells that the bluetooth service successfully identifies the headset, but having trouble to hand over the connection to the audio service.

# Fix

The most common audio service shipped with CentOS is pulseaudio. The quick fix is to restart the pulseaudio service.

```bash
pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
```

Note that both commands are meant to be run as non-root user.

# Note

If using Firefox, make sure to upgrade to ver. 71+ as older versions were not shipped with built-in mp3 codec.
