[React Native(RN)][rn] is a cross-platform development tool that endeavours the ideal "write once and run everywhere". Here records my experiences in learning RN.

# Solved Problems

This section exclusively records what I have learnt that [RN][rn] can solve.

## Code Re-use across Android-iOS-Web

The basic functionality of [RN][rn] is to reuse codes in the same app built for different platforms. The basic syntax for the cross-platform codes is [JSX][jsx].

## Light-weight Development Environment(Expo)

If all the build processes are run locally, an enormous amount of toolchains are required to be installed locally, e.g. Android/iOS SDK. [Expo][expo] is a generous platform that allows everyone to build apps without a complete local environment. The most useful commands are:

- **expo build:android**: can also build ios app and web bundles
- **expo start:web**: can also start development server for android and iOS

- note 1: I usually use `expo start:web -m tunnel` as I believe that the tunnel mode allows the server to be masked by forward proxies
- note 2: To run the web server on a custom port, set the environment variable `WEB_PORT` to the desired port. to the desired port.
