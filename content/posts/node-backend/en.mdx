Here I record the issues found during the development of backend services running in Node.js.

# POST

There are 2 commonly used libraries to handle POST request: Formidable and Body-Parser.

## Formidable

This tool can handle both field values and files. It is less popular than it's counterpart though.

## Body Parser

This tool can handle only field values. There are 2 formats: url encoded and json.

```typescript
import bodyParser from 'body-parser'
```

### URL Encoded

```typescript
server.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
```

### JSON

The client must set header `Content-Type` to `application/json` for Body Parser to understand the request.

```typescript
server.use(bodyParser.json())
```

# Authentication

There are vaguely 2 approaches to provide authentication service. Both share some common features.

# Common Features

No matter which approach is chosen, the following features must be implemented:

1. user registration, login, logout and login status check
2. administration actions, including invitation, role playing, user deletion, user addition, user reset etc.
3. persistent storage for users' credentials and session token

# Self Contained

For small-scale systems where sub-systems are independent of each other, authentication can be handled by each sub-system individually.

The commonly used stack for this approach is:

* MongoDB
* Passport.js
* Express.js

# Centralized

For deeply coupled sub-systems, they need to share a single central authentication service
