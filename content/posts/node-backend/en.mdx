Here I record the issues found during the development of backend services running in Node.js.

# POST

There are 2 commonly used libraries to handle POST request: Formidable and Body-Parser.

## Formidable

This tool can handle both field values and files. It is less popular than it's counterpart though.

## Body Parser

This tool can handle only field values. There are 2 formats: url encoded and json.

```typescript
import bodyParser from 'body-parser'
```

### URL Encoded

```typescript
server.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
```

### JSON

The client must set header `Content-Type` to `application/json` for Body Parser to understand the request.

```typescript
server.use(bodyParser.json())
```
