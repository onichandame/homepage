[IPFS][ipfs] is designed to lay the foundation of the next-generation web, in hope of replacing the old HTTP-based web. It's potential is more than it's design though.

Built on top of the p2p network connected by [libp2p][libp2p], on which IPFS is based, many fancy applications becomes possible.

The comman setup for all nodes are below:

```bash
ipfs config --json Experimental.Libp2pStreamMounting true
ipfs config --json Swarm.EnableAutoRelay 'true'
```

The first command allows to open long-running connections between nodes. The second command enables the automatic detection and usage of relay servers.

# Windows Setup

Before diving into the applications, some precautions are required when a node resides on a Windows machine.

## WSL 2

The latest version of WSL 2 is a blazing fast Linux environment on Windows machines. It is recommended to run applications in WSL 2 if possible. Hence I run a go-ipfs instance in WSL 2 and use it as a server for many cases.

## Restart on Reboot

A common requirement for a server is to restart the services on system reboot. This can be achieved using Windows Task Scheduler.

The following services should be restarted on reboot:

1. the IPFS node: `ipfs daemon`
2. the sshd instance: `/usr/sbin/sshd` (if used as an SSH server)

The port forward services described below may also be managed by Task Scheduler.

# Connection Setup

Most of the existing applications are based on address-based routing. But IPFS is mostly used for content-based routing. This difference makes many trivial applications troublesome.

To connect 2 IPFS nodes, one needs to initiate the connection from one node(client) to another(server).

The command to connect 2 nodes is:

```bash
ipfs ping <Server ID>
ipfs swarm connect /p2p/<Server ID>
```

In the cases when the direct connection is not successful, one simply needs to ping the server.

# SSH Across NAT

[SSH][ssh] is a remote login tool based on a TCP connection. IPFS has [an experimental feature][tunnel] that is able to set up a TCP connection between two nodes regardless of the traditional network topology. That being said, it can connect machines behind impenetrable NAT.

## Server Setup

The server needs to listen on connections and forward the stream to the sshd instance.

```bash
ipfs p2p listen /x/ssh /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/22
```

## Client Setup

On the client side things are similar. I have made [a docker image][client] for the client setup. The Dockerfile can be found [here][clientdf]. This image can also be used as the server. The only manual step required is to run `/usr/sbin/sshd`.

# Proxy

A common scenario is to run a web service on a server and access the server from a client. The protocol is usually based on TCP. To proxy TCP connections, the following setup is required.

## Server

The server needs to listen on a port.

```bash
ipfs p2p listen /x/kickass/1.0 /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/<Server port>
```

## Client

The client needs to proxy the port exposed by the server to a local port.

```bash
ipfs p2p forward /x/kickass/1.0 /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/<Local port> /p2p/<Server port>
```

Now the web service on the server can be accessed from the _Local port_.
