Unit test is a must for autiomated CI/CD workflow. Here I record some challenges solved with Jest.

```typescript
describe("module 1", () => {
  test("dances", () => expect(module1.dance()).toBeTruthy())
})
```

# Asynchronous Code

Jest runs tests in parallel so each test must have a clear termination point. If everything is synchronous, simply return an expect function will tell Jest where to stop.

The problem becomes apparent if the test callback is asynchronous.

```typescript
describe("module 1", () => {
  test("dances", async () => expect(module1.dance()).toBeTruthy())
})
```

The above code still functions well if `module1.dance()` is synchronous. What happens if the resolved value needs to be tested?

```typescript
describe("module 1", () => {
  test("dances", async () => expect(await module1.dance()).toBeTruthy())
})
```

The above is a simple solution to the simple question. What if the question becomes more complicated?

```typescript
describe("module 1", done => {
  test("dances", async () => {
    expect.assertions(1)
    const dance = await module1.dance()
    dance.on("spin", speed => {
      expect(speed).toBeGreaterThan(5)
      done()
    })
  })
})
```

The above code is an example where the `done` function is useful. The test is considered finished when the `done` function is called inside the test. Another use case of `done` is the `beforeAll` hook.

```typescript
beforeAll(async done => {
  await dep1
  await dep2
  done()
})
```

Without the use of `done`, Jest will run the callback synchronously so the tests will start before `dep1` and `dep2` are resolved.
