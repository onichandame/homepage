When developing backend services, it is usually a good idea to decouple the services by routing all the communications through a messaging layer.

[NATS][nats] is a cross-language messaging layer. It officially supports clients written in Golang, TypeScript, Java, etc. The biggest difference compared to the traditional messaging service such as Kafka is that NATS delivers a *at-most-once* strategy, meaning each message will be delivered to the subscribers at most once. The delivery is allowed to fail and the failure is expected to be handled by the applications.

The *at-most-once* design is somewhat resembling the PubSub system or the event emitter/listener system. A very useful feature NATS provides is the request-reply function, where the publisher awaits at least one subscriber to have replied.

# Development Setup

To develop services based on NATS, several common issues must be addressed.

## Mock NATS Client

Unit test is a necessity to build a robust service. A common practice is to mock all the actions that requires external resources during the unit test. NATS connection is one of the resources requiring mocking.

[This repo][orig-mock] provides a mocked NATS client for JavaScript. There are some caveats tho: it is not shipped with types and it does not fully support the subscription options.

Therefore I made [my own fork][mock] published as `@onichandame/mock-nats-client`. My fork is written in TypeScript and utilizes the original typing of NATS Client. As a result, the mocked functions have the same signatures as the original NATS Client.

## Start NATS Server

There are times when multiple clients instances must be able to communicate during testing. In which case a mocked client does not satisfy the demands so a real NATS server must be started. [This lib][nats-server] was created for this purpose. However, it does not run on Github Action or Windows.

## Github Action

To start a NATS server/cluster during testing on Github Action, I created [this action][nats-action] for bootstrapping NATS server/cluster in actions, and [this action][nats-client] to test if the server/cluster is up and running.
